# CODECRAFT_CS_01

This particular repository is about a task given to me during my internship in codecraft. I have developed my skills in CyberSecurity through this Internship. The task implemented in this repo is "Implementing Ceaser Cipher".  

The Brief of the given task is Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Project Structure

'''Caesar_Cipher \n
├── caesar_cipher.py # Main script for encryption and decryption \n
├── README.md # Project documentation'''

## Setup

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Caesar_Cipher.git
cd Caesar_Cipher
```

## 2. Run the program

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
```

## Usage
When you run the script, you’ll be prompted to:

- Choose between encryption or decryption  
- Enter your message  
- Enter the shift value (e.g., 3)
