# CODECRAFT_CS_01

This particular repository is about a task given to me during my internship in codecraft. I have developed my skills in CyberSecurity through this Internship. The task implemented in this repo is "Implementing Ceaser Cipher".  

The Brief of the given task is Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
